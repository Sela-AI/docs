<Note>
  The easiest way to use our API is via our [Zapier Integration](https://zapier.com/developer/public-invite/210854/814e5d3830201d32af913e6b9e63f1c9/). However, if you need full transparency and increased flexibility, you can use our API directly.

## Welcome

Sela API is designed to receive leads, perform one or more phone calls, and to send updates back to you via webhooks.

Before you can do this, you need to obtain an API token. Please chat with Sela by calling [(337) 561-1412](tel:+13375611412)

There are two ways to build API documentation: [OpenAPI](https://mintlify.com/docs/api-playground/openapi/setup) and [MDX components](https://mintlify.com/docs/api-playground/mdx/configuration). For the starter kit, we are using the following OpenAPI specification.

## Authentication

All API endpoints are authenticated using a Token in the http request header.
If you are using our [Zapier App](https://zapier.com/developer/public-invite/210854/814e5d3830201d32af913e6b9e63f1c9/), the prefix "Token " will be included automatically, so you need to copy and paste only your 40 character token.

```json
{"Authorization": "Token abc123..."}
```
