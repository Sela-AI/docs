## Sales skills

The #1 differentiator of our agents are their incredible sales skills. Our bots can perform many of these skills at a level similar to the best human reps

- Discovery
- Qualification
- Objection handling
- Personalized pitch


## Website actions

Sela agents can access and perform actions on websites in real-time during phone calls. This is very useful for cases where an API integration is not available.

## RAG (Retrieval Augmented Generation)

You can link your data sources for more detailed answers.

## Scheduling

### Automatic callback scheduling

All of our agents have an ability to call the user back at their specified day and time. For example, if the user says "Can you call me back tomorrow", the agent will automatically schedule a follow up call and make the call at the right time.

### Calendar integrations

Our agents can check availability and book meetings on
- [Calendly](https://calendly.com/)
- [Cal.com](https://cal.com/)

## Voicemail

Our agents can detect voicemail and leave a dynamic voicemail message.

## IVR Nagivation

Sela can navigate an IVR (Interactive voice response) system. But she still doesn't have fingers, it is all software.

## Call transfer

Sela can transfer the call to another phone number.

## Zapier

You can use our [Zapier app](https://zapier.com/developer/public-invite/210854/814e5d3830201d32af913e6b9e63f1c9/) to integrate sela with your CRM or perform additional automations.
